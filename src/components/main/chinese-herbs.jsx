      <h2>Chinese Herbs</h2>
      <p>Alongside acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine is the other major pillar of Chinese medicine. It is based on the belief that the body is governed by the opposing forces of Yin and Yang. The interaction of these forces gives rise to an energy known as Qi which flows through twelve energy channels in the body. However, when these channels are blocked, illness can occur. Herbs work on these channels to improve the flow of Qi and restore equilibrium to the body.</p>
      <p>Herbs tends to be highly specific in their actions, and herbal formulae contain a range of herbs that not only possess different qualities and properties but also target different aspects of the patientâ€™s disharmony. Adverse reactions to Chinese herbs are extremely rare and are negligible when compared to those commonly produced by pharmaceutical drugs.</p>
      <h3>Prepared Patent Herbs</h3>
      <p>Many of the classic formulae that have been developed over the centuries are considered so useful that they are manufactured in really available patent forms. The herbs are usually available as pills, but some patents are offered as tinctures or as rubs, creams, sprays and poultices for external use. Patent formulae offer a quick and easy way to take Chinese herbs. Many can be remarkably effective.</p>
      <h4>Slimming tablets and teas</h4>
