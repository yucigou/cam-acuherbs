      <h2>Acupuncture</h2>
      <p>Acupuncture is the gentle insertion of a hair-fine needle into specific points of the body called acu-points to stimulate the flow of oneâ€™s Qi or natural healing energy.</p>
      <p>Acupuncture treatment has proved remarkably effective especially for many diseases that are resistant to conventional forms of therapy. It has been proven to manifest the following effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physiological analgesic;</li>
        <li>Hasten motor recovery from trauma or paralysis;</li>
        <li>Immune-enhancing effect;</li>
        <li>Homeostatic effect;</li>
        <li>The effect of body fat reduction and smoking cessation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Acupressure</h3>
      <p>The methods used in Chinese massage include the hand techniques to massage the soft tissue (muscles and tendons) of the body, acupressure techniques to directly affect the flow of Qi, and manipulation techniques to realign the musculoskeletal and ligamentous relationships.</p>
